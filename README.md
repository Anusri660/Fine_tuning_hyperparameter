 **Project Title: Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project involves systematically adjusting the hyperparameters of a machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) model to improve its performance. Hyperparameters are configuration settings used to control the training process of models, such as learning rate, number of layers, batch size, number of epochs, regularization factors, etc.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters can significantly improve the model’s accuracy, generalization ability, and convergence speed.

🎯 **Project Objectives**

Understand the effect of different hyperparameters on model performance.

Implement various hyperparameter tuning strategies.

Evaluate and compare performance across different configurations.

Optimize model accuracy and reduce overfitting/underfitting.

📁 **Dataset Used**

Example Dataset: MNIST, CIFAR-10, Titanic, Boston Housing, etc.

Dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

⚙️ **Hyperparameters Considered**
Learning Rate: Controls the step size of the gradient descent.

Batch Size: Number of samples per gradient update.

Number of Epochs: Total passes through the training data.

Number of Layers and Neurons (for DL): Affects model complexity.

Dropout Rate: Prevents overfitting by randomly disabling neurons.

Regularization (L1/L2): Penalizes complex models.

🧪 **Techniques Used for Fine-Tuning**

1. Manual Search
Try different combinations manually.

Good for beginners but inefficient.

2. Grid Search
Exhaustive search over a defined parameter grid.

Suitable for small search spaces.

Example (sklearn):

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

3. Random Search
Random combinations are sampled.

More efficient for large spaces.

Example:

from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

4. Bayesian Optimization

Uses probabilistic models to choose hyperparameters.

More intelligent and efficient.

Libraries: Hyperopt, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize.

5. Automated ML (AutoML)
Tools like Google AutoML, H2O.ai, or AutoKeras.

Automatically perform tuning and model selection.
